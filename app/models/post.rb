  # That's one of my Entities into my project. But there's no attribute on it? yeah, you right, that happens because
  # I've created this one from my Windows 10 CLI, Rails create a bunch of hidden codes and some attributes and his
  # methods also part of it.

  # If you want to know how you can add by chance, some attributes on it, you can call "add_column" method from
  # Migration Class and migrate again.
